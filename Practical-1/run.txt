Steps to Run in VS Code

Open VS Code → create a folder (e.g., fs-operations).

Inside that folder, create a file named app.js.

Paste the code above into app.js.

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~).

Run the command:
cd Practical-1
node app.js


Explanation:-
fs.writeFile() → Creates (or overwrites) a file and writes text into it.

fs.readFile() → Reads the file contents asynchronously.

fs.unlink() → Deletes the specified file.

All three functions are asynchronous, meaning they use callbacks to handle success/errors.


UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit.

It’s a character encoding used to represent text in computers.
When Node.js (or any other system) reads or writes text files, it needs to know how the characters (like A, @, ₹, 😊) are stored in binary form.

Explanation:
This program demonstrates parent-to-child communication in Angular.

The parent component (app.component.ts) sends data to the child component (student.component.ts) using property binding.

The child component uses @Input() to receive the data and display it along with its own property.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Property Binding & @Input() Explained:
- [parentMessage]="message" → sends the parent variable value to the child.
- @Input() parentMessage → receives that value in the child component.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Package.json:
Created automatically by Angular CLI when the project is initialized.
It includes project dependencies, scripts, and configuration.

-----------------------------------------------------------

dist Folder:
Created after running `ng build`.
Contains the compiled production-ready files for deployment.
